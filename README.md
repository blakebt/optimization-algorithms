# Optimization-Algorithms

This is my implementations of 3 optimizations algorithms: Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and a Genetic algorithm.

The problem presented for the Hill climbing algorithm is to find the target binary number

The genetic algorithm also finds a target binary number by giving a population scores based on difference to the target and then eliminating the half that
is furthest away and allow the remaining half to repopulate. These organisms have a chance to mutate.

The Simulated Annealing algorithm simply attempts to find the maximum of a given mathematical statement
